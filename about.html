<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Daniel. I,ll be 27 years old soon, I'm making a career change 
  to persue something that I like to do since i was a little boy. Gonna learn from
  the start. I worked as a system engineer for abit but I could'nt express myself 
  like how I could do when i code. I had a tough experience with coding during my
  degree days, had fights with the lecturers and had to switch faculty just so I 
  don't get held back on my bachelors. It is what it is I guess, we move on.
</p>

<p>I'm going to persue this until I land a job at some of the biggest tech company.
  I wanna do cool things with this, it's not gonna be easy but I'm here for it.
</p>

<p>Learning this cause web3 gonna be what the future is and it's not too late
  to get this skill and to go out and beyond with it.
